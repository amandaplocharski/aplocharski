## The spirits of The Hatchet townhouse

This is a video I produced for The Hatchet's annual Halloween Guide where we brought a psychic/medium into our newspaper's townhouse to see if he could communicate with any spirits living within our walls.

## Student discusses living on campus this fall

This video highlights the type of work that I was able to produce during the peak of the pandemic when being away from my campus, yet continuing to have to report on it. The GW Hatchet was also one of the only student newspapers that continued to produce content when students were sent home in the 2020 spring semester.
